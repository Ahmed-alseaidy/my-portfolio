        <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Ahmed Mostafa</strong>, a passionate <strong>Computer Science student</strong> with a strong interest in <strong>cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and penetration testing</strong>. My journey began with a curiosity about how technology works and a deep desire to secure digital systems.</p>
        
        <p>Over the past few years, I’ve been sharpening my skills by studying computer systems, learning programming, and diving deep into ethical hacking techniques. I’ve completed notable courses like <strong>CS50</strong> from Harvard, and I’m constantly learning about <strong>network security, web vulnerabilities, and exploit development</strong>.</p>
        
        <p>I specialize in <strong>bug bounty hunting</strong> — searching for and reporting security vulnerabilities in websites and applications to help make the internet a safer place. I believe that ethical hacking is not just a skill, but a responsibility.</p>
        
        <p>My goal is to work in the field of cybersecurity as a professional <strong>penetration tester</strong> and eventually earn certifications like <strong>CEH, OSCP, and CompTIA Security+</strong>. I’m also interested in contributing to open-source security tools and collaborating with other ethical hackers around the world.</p>
        
        <p>Outside of tech, I’m disciplined, self-motivated, and currently training to meet the physical requirements to apply to the <strong>Egyptian Military Academy</strong>. I believe in balancing mental and physical strength to achieve success.</p>
        
        <p>Thanks for visiting my portfolio! I’m always open to connect, collaborate, or contribute to cybersecurity projects.</p>
